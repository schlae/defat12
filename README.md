# Quick and Dirty FAT12 Filesystem Converter

This is a really crappy Python script I wrote to convert a semi-compatible FAT12 filesystem from my HP150's hard drive and write it to a ZIP file, including proper modify dates and subdirectories. Attributes are not copied.

Lots of stuff is hardcoded to my particular hard drive image.

This is really meant for educational purposes. Don't use it and expect it to work.
